As you are running through these backgrounds you have to press the spacebar to jump and avoid dangerous spikes. If you hit the spikes you die and the game is over. Every 5 jumps the background changes aswell as your character. There is a score keeper in the top left keeping track how how well and how long you are staying alive.</p>
